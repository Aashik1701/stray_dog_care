StrayDogApp - Expo React Native scaffold

This folder contains a minimal Expo-powered React Native app scaffold created from the project guide.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies

   npm install

2. Start the dev server

   npx expo start

3. Run on a device or simulator (from Expo UI) or use

   npm run android
   npm run ios

Notes
- This scaffold adds basic navigation and three starter screens: Home, AddDog, Map.
- It expects you to have Node.js and Expo CLI installed. If you don't have Expo CLI installed globally, use npx expo.
